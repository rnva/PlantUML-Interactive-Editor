# PlantUML Interactive Editor

Welcome to PlantUML Interactive Editor! This application is designed to provide an intuitive and interactive environment for editing PlantUML code and generating diagrams in real-time. Whether you're creating a huge activity diagram or a single while loop, our tool streamlines the process, allowing you to focus on design rather than syntax.

With PlantUML Interactive Editor, you can:

- Edit PlantUML activity diagrams by directly interacting with the diagram
- Also change the diagram by editing the PlantUML code, just like other PlantUML editors, allowing you to choose code or interactive editing depending on what is easier in the moment
- Instantly preview diagrams as you type
- Easily share the created diagram

## Usage

- Right-click on elements to open context menu
- Double-click on elements to edit the text
- Submit edited text with the button or using CTRL + ENTER
- Left-click and drag in the diagram to pan
- Use mouse wheel or pinch on touch pad to zoom
- Delete the text of a title, note or group/partition to delete the element
- To share a diagram, just copy the URL in the address bar
- Hover over elements to see the corresponding line highlighted in the editor
- Clicking on, or hovering over, a line in the editor highlights the corresponding element in the diagram — all element types in both activity and sequence diagrams
- Collapse the code editor pane by clicking the chevron on the pane divider (or dragging the divider past its minimum width) to give the diagram more space; expand it again the same way

## VS Code extension

A VS Code extension in [`plantuml-extension/`](./plantuml-extension/) provides the
same interactive editing inside a VS Code webview, with the VS Code text editor
standing in for the in-browser code editor. It reuses this project's frontend
unchanged and runs the backend as a child process, so the diagram interactions
behave identically. See [`plantuml-extension/README.md`](./plantuml-extension/README.md)
for setup and [`docs/vscode_extension_interactivity.md`](./docs/vscode_extension_interactivity.md)
for the design.

## Pre-requisites
