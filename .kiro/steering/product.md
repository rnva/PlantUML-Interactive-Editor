# Product Overview

## Purpose

PlantUML Interactive Editor is a web-based tool that provides an intuitive visual interface for creating and editing PlantUML activity diagrams. Unlike traditional PlantUML editors that require writing code, this tool allows users to directly interact with diagram elements through clicking, dragging, and context menus.

## Target Users

Enterprise developers and technical teams (primarily at Ericsson and similar companies) who need to create technical documentation with activity diagrams. Users benefit from:
- Reduced PlantUML syntax learning curve
- Faster diagram creation through visual editing
- Flexibility to switch between visual and code editing as needed

## Key Features

- **Interactive diagram editing**: Right-click context menus, double-click to edit text, drag to pan
- **Dual editing modes**: Edit via diagram interaction or PlantUML code
- **Real-time preview**: Diagrams update instantly as you type or make changes
- **URL-based sharing**: Share diagrams by copying the URL (diagram encoded in address bar)
- **Bidirectional highlighting**: Hover over diagram elements to highlight code, click code to highlight elements
- **VS Code extension**: The same interactive editing is available inside a VS Code webview (`plantuml-extension/`), with the VS Code editor standing in for the in-browser code editor

## Supported Diagram Elements

### Activity Diagrams
- Activities (colored, with embedded links)
- If/else statements, switch statements
- While loops, repeat-while loops
- Fork/join parallel processing
- Start/stop/end markers
- Connectors, notes, titles
- Groups and partitions (partial support)

### Sequence Diagrams
- Participants (add left/right, rename, delete with cascade)
- Add messages between participants; edit message text and arrow color
- Notes (add with a choice of type - Note, H Note, R Note; edit text, type, and background color; delete)
- Activation bars (activate, deactivate, destroy participants)
- Group blocks (group, alt, opt, loop): add, rename title, delete (unwraps, keeping contents)
- Participant boxes: add around contiguous participants (ghost-box gesture), edit title/color, delete (unwraps, keeping participants); nested boxes supported via the teoz engine
- Bidirectional hover highlighting between the editor and messages, participants, notes, group blocks, and participant boxes

## Business Objectives

1. Streamline activity diagram creation for technical documentation
2. Lower the barrier to entry for PlantUML adoption
3. Improve documentation quality through easier diagram maintenance
