"""Parsing of participant declaration lines.

The rename logic has to tell apart the displayed name (what the SVG shows, and
therefore what a click resolves to) from the alias (what the diagram body
refers to), and must hand back every modifier it did not touch. These tests pin
that split down for each declaration form PlantUML accepts.
