"""Copy the web app's frontend into the extension so the webview can load it.

The extension reuses the web app's interaction code verbatim -- activity.js,
sequence-*.js and the context-menu markup implement every diagram interaction
already, and reimplementing them would fork thousands of lines. The webview
cannot read out of src/plantuml_gui/, so the files are mirrored into
plantuml-extension/media/.

Copying by hand is what this script exists to prevent: two copies of
activity.js diverge, and then a bug gets fixed in one of them.

The output is generated, not committed -- media/{app,menus,vendor} is
gitignored. `npm install` regenerates it via the postinstall hook, and
`vscode:prepublish` regenerates it before every VSIX, so a stale mirror cannot
be committed or reach anyone else's clone. What it can still do is go stale in
your own working tree: run `npm run sync-assets` after touching anything under
src/plantuml_gui/static or templates/partials, or `--check` to find out whether
you need to.

The menu partials are rendered through Jinja rather than copied, because
sequence_menus.html defines and calls a `color_select` macro -- a plain copy
would leave `{{ color_select(...) }}` in the HTML and the colour dropdowns
would silently not exist.
