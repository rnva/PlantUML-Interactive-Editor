// Makes the VS Code document look like an Ace editor.

// The web app's interaction code (app/script.js, app/activity.js,
// app/sequence-*.js) is loaded into this webview unmodified. It reaches the
// source through exactly one object -- Ace's `editor` -- and through a
// surprisingly small slice of its API: 58 session.getValue() calls, two
// session.setValue(), a few markers, and a cursor read. This file supplies an
// object with that shape, backed by the VS Code document instead of Ace.
//
// The single most important line is session.setValue(): every one of the ~71
// diagram operations ends by calling setPuml(), which calls setValue(). Point
// it at the document and all of them write to the file.
//
// See docs/vscode_extension_interactivity.md, "The two shims".
